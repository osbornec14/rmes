                                            In simplest terms, radon is a natural occurring gas whose particles are radioactive (#86… Rn-222 on the Periodic Table of Elements). Pressurized earth gas gathering under the basement floor or a home’s slab or crawl space areas, pushes through these cement floor or open areas, bringing in humidity, natural occurring elements, and chemicals that are in the dirt the gasses pass through. This gas in total might contain water (humidity), methane, radon, fertilizers or other chemicals leaching through the soils under a house or neighborhood.                                    </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Radon, being radioactive, is the most dangerous of any of the contaminants coming into a house. In quantity, it can be extremely dangerous. The EPA and other health agencies throughout the world agree on the health danger and impact. Of the 160,000 deaths from lung cancer in the US per year, 24,000 were “never smokers”. There has been a US Surgeon General Warning regarding radon since 1988, and for several years now, the EPA has proclaimed that the US looses 21,000-45,000 people per year due to radon induced lung cancer. Europe claims to have the same losses.                                    </p>
                                        <p>
                                            These mortality figures are calculated on a theorem based on historical factors relative to worldwide radiation studies over the last 100+ years. The EPA postulates that putting the total population of the US (approximately 291M people) in an environment of 1.25pCi/L… the average radon rate in households across the US, will yield a mortality rate of 21,000 - 45,000 deaths in the US per year.                                        </p>

                                            </header>
                                            <p>
                                                In Wisconsin, this would relate to a total population rate of approximately 5.5M people, again 
                                                being put into this same 1.25pCi/L, for a declared death rate of 411 (to 880) people per year, 
                                                per the State of WI and EPA. The problem with this declared number? Few people in WI have homes 
                                                with a radon rate of 1.25pCi/L throughout their homes (see EPA/WI map at bottom of this page)! 
                                                If a person took an average radon rate in all of southern and central Wisconsin… the highest 
                                                populated areas of Wisconsin, 10pCi/L would be a highly conservative average of basement 
                                                radon rates, with 50%-100% (5-10pCi/L) being the average in upstairs “living” areas. If we 
                                                assigned a rate of 7.5pCi/L to the general population of WI (instead of the 1.25pCi/L that very 
                                                few have), it would yield a projected death rate of 2,466 - 5,277 (3,871 average) per year.

                                                    An important thing to remember with radon is that it causes lung “damage”. Only so many people 
                                                    with this “damage” will get cancer from it. It’s very similar to sun exposure to humans on many 
                                                    levels. Skin damage from the sun’s radiation exposure can cause Melanoma. It’s easy to find people 
                                                    in the Southern or Western US with a lot of skin damage from the sun that has occurred over their 
                                                    lifetime. Some will get cancer from this damage, others won’t… but the damage is still there. 
                                                    This is comparable to radon and lung damage that can cause lung cancer. Lung damage is simply 
                                                    impossible to visually see on a daily basis!

                                                    • Radon is an airborne cancer causing radioactive element, produced by the natural occurring breakdown of uranium in soil, rock and water.<br><br>

                                                    • The Breakdown Chain of Uranium is ... Uranium, Thorium, Radium (can be ingested from drinking water), Radon (can be inhaled), Polonium. Bismuth ... and finally…. Lead.  Lead does not leave the human body.  It builds up in the brain, fatty tissue. and bone marrow, potentially causing blood related diseases (Leukemia) and brain tumors.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    • Radon is one of the oldest researched carcinogens in the world, investigated since the 1500's and finally identified in 1879.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    • Radon follows the "linear, no threshold model" of radiation ... simply meaning the higher the rate, the more deadly it is.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    • A radon level of 15 pCi/L (not unusual in southern WI) is equivalent in lung damage to each person living within a household smoking a pack of cigarettes per day.  Each additional 15pCi/L is equal to smoking an additional pack of cigarettes per day.  In other words, a level of 60 pCi/L, fairly common in communities west of Milwaukee, is the equivalent to smoking 4 packs of cigarettes per day.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    • The EPA (2008) estimated that upward of 123 people die each day (one every 12 minutes) within the United States from radon induced lung cancer.  The same number of people die in Europe each year from radon induced lung cancer.  Worldwide ... about 100,000 deaths from radon per year!
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    • According to the World Health Organization (WHO ... Oct. 2009), the radon "Action Point" world-wide should be 2.7pCi/L, and every time 2.7pCilL is doubled (5.4pCi/L, etc.) a person's chances of getting lung cancer during their lifetime goes up by 20 times.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    • According to the World Health Organization (WHO ... Oct. 2009), the worlds radon "issues" can be blamed on architects and builders not paying attention to the problem.  New home construction methods for radon were developed and printed in the early 1990’s, yet most architects and builders have never studied these methods, or use them.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    • New homes perform no better than older homes, relative to high radon rates.  New homes however, have more incidents of radon rates over 2OpCi/L, than older houses do.  This may have to do with deeper basements (higher gas pressure under the slab) to achieve higher basement ceiling levels.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    • Well over half the homes in southern & central Wisconsin have high radon levels. The State of WI estimates that well over a million homes within the State have high radon levels.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    • There are accounts of homes measuring over 300 pCi/L in Southern WI ... the equivalent in lung damage to each person living within a household smoking over 24 packs of cigarettes per day ... or an annual radiation exposure that's equivalent to over 15,000 chest X-rays.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    • Radon can only be detected through testing. You can't smell, taste, or see radon.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    • According to the World Health Organization (WHO ... October 2009), past and present cigarette smokers are 7 times more susceptible to lung cancer living In a high radon environment.  This rate is down from "15 times", as previously thought.  The WHO claims mortality numbers are the same... but they found that radon was about twice the health concern as previously thought.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    • 4pCi/L .. the EPA action point, is the equivalent radiation to 200 chest X-rays every year! A level of 10pCi/L is the equivalent to nearly 500 chest X-rays with in a year’s time, and 20pCi/L is equivalent to nearly 1,000 chest X-rays per year! All these levels are highly prevalent in Southern WI.

A level of 10pCi/L is the equivalent to nearly 500 chest X-rays within a year’s time, and 20pCi/L is equivalent to nearly 1,000 chest X-rays per year!  All these levels are highly prevalent within homes in Southern and Central Wisconsin.

                                                    • The higher the radon rate in a basement, the higher the rate throughout the entire house.  Typically, the first floor of the house is 1/2 to 3/4 the radon level of the basement.  With a forced- air heating / cooling system, once radon enters the first floor, the furnace carries it evenly to the rest of the house.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    • The EPA says that there are no "safe" levels of radon.  4.0pCi/L is the EPA real estate "Action Point"... not a safe level!  This level is equal to smoking over 127 packs of cigarettes per year, or a relative amount of radiation to having over 200 chest X-rays per year.

                                                    • The EPA claims that two-thirds of all deaths per year due to radon are caused by home environments having as little as 2pCi/L - 4pCi/L.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    • The EPA designated January as National Radon Action Month as indoor radon levels can soar during the colder months when the ground outdoors is frozen, stopping radon from escaping through the soil’s surface, causing sub-soil gas to move horizontally underground, coming into homes and buildings.
